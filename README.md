### Desktop vs. Web app
The Zeplin Web app has access everything you need. 
Zeplin has macOS and Windows desktop apps, however these are not _required_ unless you're:
* Importing designs into Zeplin
* Using Zeplin [Pop-out](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/comparing-appwebsite-with-designs-using-pop-out) feature to overlay the designs on your simulator

## Project Naming Convention

### Guide
Once you start using Zeplin, it‚Äôs common to grow to having hundreds of projects. Establishing a naming convention enhances visibility of projects and discoverability.

**Naming:** use vocabulary that‚Äôs familiar to your team like team, group, platform, project, feature, epic name.

_ex. Airbnb Experience-iOS-Check-out_

**Thumbnail:** Add a thumbnail to your project that makes it easy to distinguish platform type (Web, iOS, Android) or team.

_ex. Sample thumbnail_

![zeplin](./img/artboardThumbnail.png)

_ex. Some teams color code thumbnails like this_
![zeplin](./img/project-naming.png)

### Project Naming Convention ‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO

|   Type     | Content | Example
| ------------------- |:-------------|:-------------|
| Naming Convention    |   _[Team/brand name] - [platform] - [feature]_ |    _Airbnb Experience-iOS-Check-out_   |

                                    Insert thumbnail image ‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO

<br>


## Project Structure

Having a standard project structure helps other team members effectively navigate through your project especially your developer counterpart.

**Project Description:** add links to documentation and relevant stakeholders.

**Sections:** group screens by user flow, features or epics.

**Section Descriptions:** brief description of each section.

**Screen Tags:** group screens by design stage, team names, date, version or screen type like Empty State or Pop-up

### ‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO

|   Type     | Content | Example
| ------------------- |:-------------|:-------------|
| We will use Project Descriptions to describe    |          |       |
| We will group Screens into Sections by    |    |      |
| We will use Section Description to describe    |  |        |
| We will group Screens with tags by    |   |       |


## Sharing Projects
Having a standard and clear way to share screens reduce unnecessary back and forth or any chances of miscommunication.

**Links:** Use links to a specific set of screens using tags or sections

**Sharing:** Choose a standard channel to share links like Slack, Github, and Jira

![zeplin](./img/sharing.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO 

#### Sharing Links

|   Type     | Location 
| ------------------- |:-------------|
| We will use group and share links using        | 
| We will share our links in    |    | 


## Layers
Layer units are specific to the Zeplin project type (Web, iOS, Android).

|Platform        | Unit  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| iOS      | pt |
| Android      | dp     |
| Web | px |

## Extensions & Code Snippets
Extensions are the mechanism Zeplin uses to generate code snippets. Some are platform specific, and some are platform agnostic. These will be used by your developers to implement your designs.

All Zeplin extensions are JavaScript modules that generate code snippets from various design elements. All code snippets you interact with in Zeplin are generated using extensions. Developers can write their own if they wish, [read more](https://github.com/zeplin/zeplin-extension-documentation) about Zeplin extensions.

## Notes 

**Colors:** use it to indicate the type of note you are leaving or the status of a notes:
ex.)

|Color        | Exaxmple usage  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| **Green**   | Designer adding details like describing animations |
| **Orange**    |  Developer roadblock or requesting changes to design  |
| **Red**       |  Comments from PM team  |
| **Green**     |  Resolve comments to reduce clutter  |

#### Color Assignment ‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO 
|Color        | Usage   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Yellow    |    |
| Orange    |    |
| Red       |    |
| Green     |    |
| Cyan      |    |
| Blue      |    |
| Purple    |    |

## Versions (history)

**Commit Message:** add descriptive message to clarify changes. 

_ex._

    Do this‚Ä¶ Color changed in profile background 
    Not this‚Ä¶ Color changed

**Color:** use it to indicate type of version.

_ex._

    Based on stages - red for experiment, green for approved
    Based on changes - red for major, yellow for minor,

**Delete versions:** frequent exports to Zeplin can clutter version history.

#### Version Color Assignment ‚ö†Ô∏è#TODO 
|Version Color        | Usage   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Yellow    |    |
| Orange    |    |
| Red       |    |
| Green     |    |
| Cyan      |    |
| Blue      |    |
| Purple    |    |

# Zeplin Guide for Developers ‚öóÔ∏è üìö 

##### Legend: üí°: Pro-tip

## Welcome to Zeplin
Zeplin is a designer/developer collaboration tool. Designers upload their artboards/screens via their preferred design program (Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop) into Zeplin. Team members in Zeplin can view designs, make comments, tag others, view layer data, code snippets, components, and download image assets. 

Zeplin acts as a source of truth for development to implement in a connected space, encouraging collaboration by all project stakeholders. 

>üí° Zeplin helps make your design, development, and collaboration life easier.

## Team Collaboration ([read more](https://support.zeplin.io/quick-start/collaborating-with-your-team))

### Commenting

You can quickly add a note by Cmd + Clicking (Ctrl for Windows and Linux users) anywhere on the screen. You can even mention other teammates with ‚Äú@‚Äù and they will receive a notification.

If you're tagged in a  note, you can resolve that note.

![alt text](./img/monkey.png "Naming convention for image assets")
>üí°Show/hide notes on a design by clicking the üôà icon

### Inviting more teammates

## Layers
Layer units are specific to the Zeplin project type (Web, iOS, Android).

|Platform        | Unit  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| iOS      | pt |
| Android      | dp     |
| Web | px |

### Measurements 
By clicking on an element you can see its size. Once clicked you can move your mouse around and see spacing it is from other elements. Additionally, on the right panel, any assets, colors, coordinates, and code markup such as CSS will be present. An example of this action is shown below. 


## Styleguide
>üí°Quickly navigate to your project's stylguide with [Command + G] (macOS), [‚å• + S \ Alt + S] (PC /Web)

#GlennTODO

### Colors
>üí°Using color variables

>üí°[Change color formats](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/changing-color-formats) RGB, ARGB or Hex

### Text Styles
#GlennTODO

### Components

Components are reusable elements imported from your team's preferred design tools into Zeplin. 

|  Design Tool     |    Native Component name        | 
| ------------- |-------------| -----:|
| Sketch [[read more](https://support.zeplin.io/sketch-integration/exporting-components-from-sketch)]       | Symbols  | 
| Figma [[read more](https://support.zeplin.io/figma-integration/exporting-components-from-figma)]     | Components |
| XD ‚ö†Ô∏è [_coming soon_] | Symbols  |

When the team exports their symbols/components from their design tool into Zeplin, you'll be able to easily identify elements that are components. For any element that is a component, you can see a blue header on that element, in addition to a link to that component in the sidebar (_see image below_).

![alt text](./img/component.png "Components in Zeplin")

### Assets 

>üí° If you cannot download assets for a screen, remind your designers to mark those elements as exportable in their design tool. If they are marked as exported and imported into Zeplin, you'll then be able to download them! 

Like layer data, Zeplin tailors assets to the platform your project is set to. The designers on your team will need to mark the assets you need to download from Zeplin as "exportable". 

If an image is marked as exportable, Zeplin automatically provides the resources in  **1x 2x 3x densities**. ‚ú®

|Platform        | Unit  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| iOS      | PNG / PDF |
| Android      | PNG / SVG      |
| Web | PNG / SVG |

>üí°[Download ALL assets](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/downloading-all-available-assets-in-a-screen) for any screen by clicking on the "knife" icon

>üí° If you want to use your own optimization tools, SVGO optimization is configurable (on / off) in Zeplin.

![alt text](./img/namingConvention.png "Naming convention for image assets")

>üí° Asset naming convention is configurable (camelCase / snake_case / kebab-case).

![alt text](./img/namingConvention.png "Naming convention for image assets")

>üí°You can rename assets, keep in mind that this will apply only locally.
